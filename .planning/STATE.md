## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Comprehensive depth — 6 phases derived from natural requirement clusters and dependency order
- [Roadmap]: Test infrastructure before bug fixes — fixes without tests risk introducing new bugs
- [Roadmap]: UX-03 (configurable HTTP timeout) assigned to Phase 6 alongside dry-run — both are UX polish delivered last

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: foundry-test-utils v1.2.2 is young (created June 2025) — verify mock coverage for game.actors.has, canvas.scene.tokens, CompendiumCollection before committing to it as sole mock source
- [Research]: v12 SceneNavigation.displayProgressBar() signature needs validation against actual v12 instance before Phase 5 ships
- [Research]: Dialog.confirm v13 shim will be removed in v14 — document as known future breaking change during Phase 6
