# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** Token replacement must work correctly and predictably every time — no silent failures, no corrupted state, no confusing errors.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Test Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Test Infrastructure)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Phase 1 complete — ready for Phase 2
Last activity: 2026-03-01 — Phase 1 Plan 1 executed: test infrastructure configured

Progress: [##░░░░░░░░] 17%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Test Infrastructure | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3 min)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Comprehensive depth — 6 phases derived from natural requirement clusters and dependency order
- [Roadmap]: Test infrastructure before bug fixes — fixes without tests risk introducing new bugs
- [Roadmap]: UX-03 (configurable HTTP timeout) assigned to Phase 6 alongside dry-run — both are UX polish delivered last
- [01-01]: Vitest 3.x (not 4.x) due to foundry-test-utils peer dependency constraint on vitest ^3.1.0
- [01-01]: v8 coverage provider for native ESM support without transpilation
- [01-01]: Guard project mocks with globalThis checks for forward compatibility

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: foundry-test-utils v1.2.2 is young (created June 2025) — verify mock coverage for game.actors.has, canvas.scene.tokens, CompendiumCollection before committing to it as sole mock source
- [Research]: v12 SceneNavigation.displayProgressBar() signature needs validation against actual v12 instance before Phase 5 ships
- [Research]: Dialog.confirm v13 shim will be removed in v14 — document as known future breaking change during Phase 6
